Micri Examples
==============

This is a collection of examples on how to use `micri` to create HTTP backed
services.

How to Use
----------

All the examples under this directory requires that you have first built
`micri` in the root directory of this repository.

```bash
# npm
npm install
npm run build
# yarn
yarn install
yarn build
```

Once that's done you can `cd` into one of the example directories and check the
`README.md` file there. Most of the examples require `install` and `build`
before running the `start` script.
